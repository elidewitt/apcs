For the past few assignments I was getting tired of the manual labor
that is retyping the same thing but with different numbers. I
challenged myself to use lists and loops while still fitting the
criteria. So I did some research on how to use lists and for loops in
java and made adding new items and locations so much easier. I spent
too much time trying to figure out how to use multidimentional arrays
nested objects but my current solution works.

I don't have a link for my conversions. I just googled "currency
conversion" and google had an embeded converter. Data provided by 
Monringstar for Currency and Coinbase for Cryptocurrency.
