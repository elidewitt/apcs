I already have experience with coding, so this project was very beginner for me.
I didn't have any difficulties. A part of me that is used to javascript wanted
the data to be availble and use a loop to print it but that wasn't the case here.

I didn't see much information on the PRR on the assignment page so I hope this
will suffice.

I believe this is all I need to submit, if not I'll check the feedback :)
