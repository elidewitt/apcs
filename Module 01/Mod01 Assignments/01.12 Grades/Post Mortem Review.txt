I already have experience with coding, so this project was very beginner for me.
I didn't have much difficulty.
Although I am used to JavaScript and am not totally new to the concept, declaring
variable types is unfamiliar to me and took me a minute to realize that
I had to use average = (double)totalPoints / numTests; instead of average = (double)(totalPoints / numTests);
