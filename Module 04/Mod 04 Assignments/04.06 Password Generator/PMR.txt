I feel like I did it a little overkill...
I created a static method to generate a random password by finding random numbers (with a modified range)
and casting them to type char to get my numbers, uppercase, and lowercase. Then I created a separate
static method to validate the passwords generated to make sure they contained all three pieces of critera.
I used (lots) of loops to carry out this process until the program gets lucky (doesn't take very many tries)
and finds a passwod that fits the criteria.
