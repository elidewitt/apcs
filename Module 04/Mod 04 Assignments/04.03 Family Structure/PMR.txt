I already have experience with coding, so this project was very beginner for me.
I added an additional statement in the loop to see if there were any errors,
such as typing in AB instead of what we are looking for. I also used the
String.toUpperCase method as another form of data valiation. I also created
a rounding method to be reused a few times when displaying the percentages.
