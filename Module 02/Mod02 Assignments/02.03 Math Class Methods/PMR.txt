I already have experience with coding, so this project was very beginner for me.
I didn't have any difficulties. A part of me that is used to javascript wanted
the data to be availble and use a loop to print it but that wasn't the case here.

One feature I added was a variable titled "triangles" which is an integer
defining how many triangles to calculate and display. I used for loops to help
with that process.
