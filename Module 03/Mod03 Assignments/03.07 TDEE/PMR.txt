I already have experience with coding, so this project was very
beginner for me.

I'm not a huge fan of chains of if statements. So I instead used a list
as a dictionary. So I met the criteria of "Conditional statement(s)
used. I solved the problem of accepting both uppercase and 
lowercase by using the String.toUpperCase() method immediatly after
getting the user input on the necessary inputs. When there is an
incorrect choice, it prints a message to the console at the end. I
wanted to terminate it so it wouldn't make calculations incorrectly,
but I don't really know how to do that. Instead I just set the effected
variables to 0 or 0.0.
